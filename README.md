# Cafe
 
# This program is a simulation of a cafe.

## There are several workers there: administrator, barista and cleaner.
## Cafe offers several types of tea and coffee to customers.


## Also, every day cafe can earn a lot of money or go broke. It depends on amount of money for its products.
### I'm planning to add more workers, ~~robots and beer~~ make product price more dependent on the preparation time and make it pay taxes:)

In this code I used: 
Abstraction
Inheritance
Polymorphism
```

```
I think, I next time I'll add a piece of Encapsulation. And interface.
